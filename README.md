# Stock Price Prediction
An **end-to-end Machine Learning workflow** focused on stock price forecasting. This project encompasses everything from the ML development process to the ML production lifecycle.


## üí° Features
- Forecasting stock price using Machine Learning
- Real-time dashboard showing forecasted values
- Observability dashboard for ML models and their performance
- Open APIs for data retrieval

# üöÄ ML Workflow Overview
## 1. Data Collection

**Data Sources:**
- [Binance Data Dumper](https://github.com/stas-prokopiev/binance_historical_data/tree/master): included data from 2017 to Now
- [Kaggle - prasoonkottarathil/btcinusd](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasoonkottarathil/btcinusd): only included data from 2017-2021
- [Binance API](https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance/tree/master): only support few candles per request, not suitable for historical data retrieval

**Download Historical Data:**
- Download historical data from Binance Data Dumper: `python3 data_download.py`

**Retrieve Real-time Data:**
- sample script can be found in `data_retrieval.py` (later will scheduled executed using MageAI)
